4/26/24 Friday

Rundown on existing codes

- PID_arm_angle_ctrl.py is the customized working code for PID angle control 
- RL_arm_test.py is the playground for testing RL algos with gym muscle actuator env
- colab notebook 'muscle_actuator_rl_tests' has stable_baselines algos testing code with different gym environments
- using stable_baselines SAC worked great with lunar lander with has the same continuous action space (2 actions) 
    and a larger obs space(8 obs)
- re-run stable_baselines SAC on Lunar Lander
    - after 20_000 steps, the rewards increased from -274 to 53 with stable_baselines SAC on Lunar Lander
    - SAC is not running on GPU (check later)


4/29/24 Monday

Setup github and google colab to run the muscle actuator on colab
    - make sure to change directory to muscle_actuator/pymuscle


4/30/24 Tuesday

Setup SSH key betwee google colab and github

- environment is good... similar to gym env structure... can run SAC on the env
- issues with reward function
    - right now the reward is calculated on instantaneous angle but to achieve the target angle the excitation
      should be applied for atleast a few timesteps.
    - takeaway: figure out how to include the time effect in reward function. 
    - something like: it's ok to not reach target at t=1 but not okay if the target can't be reached at t=5

5/5/24 Sunday

- added a variable to count time elapsed
- reward right now, rewards for staying close to target over time.
TODO: find a way to penalize for not staying close to target after certain time has elapsed


Add angular velocity to observation
